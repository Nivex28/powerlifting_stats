# PowerStats
Calculate mean squat, bench, deadlift, and total based on user's gender and weight class. 

Running calculate_mean() helps the user to calculate their stats by providing them with prompts and a list of input values for them, while quick_mean() skips this and takes arguments for gender, weight class, and units.

Based on open raw (no wraps) IPF affiliated meets only.

Uses data from the OpenPowerlifting project, https://www.openpowerlifting.org.
